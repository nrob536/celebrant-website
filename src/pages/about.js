        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Love is the thread that binds us and I’m endlessly inspired by its power to bring people together in the most beautiful way. I believe a ceremony is more than a moment; it’s a sacred waving of two lives, surrounded by whānau, laughter, and the whispers of legacy. Every love story I meet is as unique and breathtaking as a snowflake- delicate, powerful and beautifully one of a kind. It’s my joy and honour to help bring those stories to life, crafting ceremonies that reflect the south of your journey and the magic of your connection. If you are looking for a celebrant who brings heart, soul and a little sparkle, I’d be honoured to walk beside you and help make your day truly unforgettable.</p>
