        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When we decided to elope, we knew we still wanted our ceremony to be special and meaningful. [Your Wife's Name] created an intimate experience that exceeded all our expectations.</p>
<p>Even though it was just the two of us (plus our photographers), [Your Wife's Name] put as much care and attention into our ceremony as she would for a large wedding. She helped us craft personal vows and suggested beautiful rituals that made our elopement feel sacred and significant.</p>
<p>What we appreciated most was [Your Wife's Name]'s flexibility and adventurous spirit. Our ceremony location required a short hike, and she was completely game for the adventure! Her calm presence and genuine joy for what she does made our day so special.</p>
<p>She even helped coordinate with our photographers to ensure all the important moments were captured perfectly. The ceremony she created for us was the perfect balance of meaningful, personal, and concise - exactly what we wanted for our elopement.</p>
<p>If you're planning an elopement or intimate ceremony, we can't recommend [Your Wife's Name] highly enough. She'll create a ceremony that feels true to you as a couple, regardless of the size or location.</p>]]></content>
